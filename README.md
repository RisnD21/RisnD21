# Hi, this is Risn Foundry
(currently an independent developer)

**Unity Gameplay & Systems Programmer**  
I'm both a player and a developer.  
Games have always inspired me—their systems, their design, and their stories.

In March 2025, I began my journey as a developer,  
dedicating myself to learning how to architect and implement games.

## What I'm working on
- **Card Adventure** — my ongoing multi-system Unity project,  
  where I explore data-driven architecture, ScriptableObject pipelines,  
  modular gameplay systems (inventory, crafting, deckbuilding),  
  and AI-assisted workflows for faster iteration.


## Upcoming Repositories
- `card-adventure-systems` — refactored, open-source examples extracted  
  from my main project.  
- `unity-system-showcase` — small, focused modules (crafting, dialogue,  
  deckbuilding) presented as reusable samples.

> I'm actively developing Card Adventure and improving its architecture.
> I'll share updated versions gradually as the project takes shape.
