# 👋 Hi, I'm Yu Wei (Risn Foundry)

**Unity Gameplay & Systems Programmer**  
I'm both a player and a developer.  
Games have always inspired me—their systems, their design, and their stories.

In March 2025, I began my journey as a developer,  
dedicating myself to learning how to architect and implement games.

## 🚀 What I'm working on
- **Card Adventure** — my ongoing multi-system Unity project,  
  where I explore data-driven architecture, ScriptableObject pipelines,  
  modular gameplay systems (inventory, crafting, deckbuilding),  
  and AI-assisted workflows for faster iteration.

---

## 🛠 Skills & Focus Areas
- **Systems Architecture:** I enjoy designing modular systems,  
  clean data-flow pipelines, and event-driven systems.
  
- **Gameplay Programming:** combat logic, state machines,  
  simple perception systems, and card/deck mechanics.
  
- **UI/UX Implementation:** DOTween-driven interactions,  
  custom editors, and iterative UI workflows.
  
- **Workflow:** I focus on writing clear code, building reliable systems,  
  and improving my workflow through consistent iteration and refactoring.

## 📦 Upcoming Repositories
- `card-adventure-systems` — refactored, open-source examples extracted  
  from my main project.  
- `unity-system-showcase` — small, focused modules (crafting, dialogue,  
  deckbuilding) presented as reusable samples.

> I'm currently refactoring my prototypes into clean, modular examples,  
> and will publish them gradually as the structure stabilizes.
